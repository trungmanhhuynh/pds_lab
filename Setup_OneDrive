Recently, I need to backup my large datasets to OneDrive to save some spaces for my current research. 
OneDrive is currently offer 5GB. 

To setup onedrive, I follow this tutorial: http://woshub.com/mount-google-drive-onedrive-linux/ 
and this https://stnetwork.fr/2020/07/01/onedrive-client-centos-7 
By default, the Onedrive folder is created 

Once OneDrive is setup, I moved large datasets (e.g. Titan.rar) to this folder. If the file to too large,
we need to split the files to smaller chunks: 
```
split -b 100G titan.tar "titan.tar.part_"
```

Deleve original tar file and then run:
```
onedrive --synchronize
```
to upload files to onedrive.
